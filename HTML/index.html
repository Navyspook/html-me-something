                    <h4>1996 - 1997</h4>
                    <p>My first stop out of boot camp was NTTC in Pensacola. I attended Cryptologic Technician (Collections) "A" school and Direct Support (DIRSUP) "C" School. The white sand beaches were great for decompression time.</p>
                    <p>The next stop was Morse Code school in Fort Huachuca. Months of dits and dahs. Tomb Stone was a short ride away and was neat to see.</p>

                    <h4>1998 - 2000</h4>
                    <p>The end of my first chapter in the Navy was at NSGA Northwest. I was DIRSUP and rode different ships from the east coast of the US. I was honorably discharged from the US Navy in June of 2000, 4 years into my journey.</p>

                    <h4>2002 - 2005</h4>
                    <p>I reenlisted in the Navy in January 2002 aftera brief stint in the Army National Guard and a couple semesters at WVU Parkersburg. The USS Mobile Bay was a great command. Did six and nine month deployments in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.</p>
